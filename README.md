**Requirements**

Node.js v8.11.1, Python 3.6, npm 5.6.0 these are not strict requirements the program should work with node versions lower than this. However higher versions are not compatible at this time.

It is also encouraged but optional to use virtualenv to set up a local environment to install all dependencies.

From the main directory navigate to node folder and in your terminal run.

    > npm install
    
Once all the node modules and dependencies finish installing navigate back to the main program directory. In your terminal run.

    > pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all the required python libraries necessary to run the program. And finally type the following to run the program.

    > python main.py
